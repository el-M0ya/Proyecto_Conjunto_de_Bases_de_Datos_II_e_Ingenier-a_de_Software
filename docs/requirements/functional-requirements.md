# Functional Requirements

## Source and identifier policy

The authoritative numbering for functional requirements is the numbering in the team's Database Design Report, Section 2.1, **RF-01 through RF-45** (printed pages 5–8). These are preserved exactly; this document does not replace them with a new FR numbering scheme. The problem statement's six original informational queries are also tracked separately as REP-01 through REP-06, with original item numbers 1–6 retained.

**Primary source (S3):** *Informe — Diseño de la Base de Datos: Gestión para la generación automática de planes de entrenamiento*, Section 2.1, printed pp. 5–8. This is the 43-page report supplied as additional context for this revision; it is not yet present in the repository's `docs/` directory. The related problem statement and Database II methodological guidance are in the repository under `docs/`.

## Notes for implementation planning

- Requirement identifiers and descriptions above are source-derived and translated into English. The traceability matrix lists the source page and current issue/test mapping for each item.
- Reports RF-35 through RF-42 comprise the six report requests: report item 6 is represented by RF-40, RF-41, and RF-42 because the source query requires three result groups in one request. REP-06 preserves that as one original report item.
- RF-43 through RF-45 require frontend/report work; dedicated frontend issues have not yet been identified in the repository issue list checked for this pass.
- Exact acceptance formulas not specified by the source (for example, exercise abandonment denominator or routine-balance criteria) are marked for instructor/team confirmation rather than invented.
- The approved database design report proposes MongoDB for variable routine blocks and Redis for a cache (Section 4.9). This conflicts with the project's separately agreed implementation decision: PostgreSQL only, with the variable routine structure kept in an auxiliary `routine_structure` table using JSONB; no MongoDB and no Redis. Preserve the requirement for a separate representation of nested routine structure and its consistency, but treat MongoDB/Redis as a design conflict to reconcile—not as accepted implementation requirements.
